-   Later years in my career, I believe, are also fascinating for me. I had a chance to work more on data analyst and neural-language processing. My teammates and I put much effort into creating “viMusic”, which has the ambition of helping people to compose their own music without musical foundation. At this time, I was exposed to multiple facets and approaches in Data Science domains. 

-   With sufficient music background, I analyzed the data of music composition, clustering data into genres, using Random Forest, with the features obtained from **Spotify API**. Initially we used **conventional recurrent neural networks**, such as LTSM, for music generation, then implementing the Transformer model from the publication of **“Vaswani et al., Attention Is All You Need”**, giving a more dominant long-term pattern, performance and faster training process. The product has not been carried out to the market yet, but an internal survey showed that 23 out of 28 persons, about 82%, had positive feelings about the artificial compositions.
